## Task Assignment

Shanshan Wu: Hypothesis 5,6 and Hypothesis 2.PART2

Yuxuan Zhang: Hypothesis 3,4 and Hypothesis 2.PART3

Zhiyan Ren: Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2.PART1

All other jobs are done by group members together. 


## Hypothesis
- People are not satisfied with the app will be more likely to publish the reviews


  *find the percentage of people writing reviews V.S. rating score relationship*

- review word analysis

  *part1: words frequency among all apps*

  *part2: words frequency data visualization -->word cloud*

  *part3: a closer look in terms of positive/negative/netural comments*
  
- The rating will be higher if the application needs to be paid. 


  *find the rating score and price relations*
  
- There is biased price in Applestore 


  *find the same app, compare the price*


- For those apps higher than normal price in the store($0.99),  Game ranks the first in terms of category percentage.


  *find the apps higher than 0.99, categorize them*


- The proportion of free apps in each category is higher than paid apps.


  *categorize first, then visualize the free vs paid proportion*
