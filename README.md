# Google Play Store Apps Analysis
## General Description
Figure out the specific application categories that can generate more revenue for developers through high price and large purchase volume.

 

## Hypothesis
- The rating will be higher if the application need be paid.

- For those apps higher than normal price in the store($0.99), they fall into a specific genre.(eg:education..)

- The proportion of free  apps in each categroy is higher than paid apps.

- There is biased price in Applestore which leads to lower rating score.

- People are not satisfied with the app will be more likely to publish the reviews

- Review word language analysis

## Hypothesis
- The rating will be higher if the application need be paid. 


  *find the rating score and price correlationship*


- For those apps higher than normal price in the store($0.99), they fall into a specific genre.(eg:education


  *find the apps higher than 0.99, categorize them*


- The proportion of free  apps in each categroy is higher than paid apps.


  *categorize first, then visualize the free vs paid propotion*


- There is biased price in Applestore 


  *find the same app,compare the price*


- People are not satisfied with the app will be more likely to publish the reviews


  *find rating counts vs rating score relationship*

- review word analysis

  *part1:words frequency among all apps*
  *part2:a closer look in terms of positive/negative/netural comments*
  *part3:words frequency data visualization -->word cloud*
## Tips
i. Doctests or other unit tests. 1-person team minimum 30% actual test coverage; 2- person minimum 70% actual test coverage;3-person minimum ***80% actual coverage AND use Travis CI during development***.

ii. All functions (methods included) need complete Docstrings. 1-person=minimum 4 functions; 2-person=7+ functions; ***3-person= 10+ functions***

iii. 3-person teams also should incorporate one of these efficiency techniques that will be discussed in class (***Numba or Cython compilation or parallel processing***).
