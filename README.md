## General Description
Figure out the specific application categories that can generate more revenue for developers through high price and large purchase volume.

 

## Hypothesis

- There is biased price in Applestore which leads to lower rating score.

- ???People are not satisfied with the app will be more likely to publish the reviews

- ???People are more willing to pay for the app under specific categories such as game
